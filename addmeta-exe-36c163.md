AddMeta.exe is an executable file associated with iClone, a 3D animation software developed by Reallusion, Inc., specifically in version 7.41.2525. This file is typically safe and is not considered a virus or malware, as it is an integral part of the iClone application, designed to manage and add metadata to projects. However, like any executable, it can sometimes lead to errors or issues if the software is improperly installed, corrupted, or if there are conflicts with other applications. Users may encounter problems such as crashing or slow performance if there are underlying issues with the application or the system it is running on. It's important to ensure that iClone is kept up to date and to run regular antivirus scans to maintain the security and performance of the system.
